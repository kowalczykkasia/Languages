 My Aunt Helen lived with the family for the last few years of her life because something very
bad happened to her. Nobody would tell me what happened then even though I always wanted to
know. When I was around seven, I stopped asking about it because I kept asking like kids always
do and my Aunt Helen started crying very hard.
 That’s when my dad slapped me, saying, “You’re hurting your aunt Helen’s feelings!” I didn’t
want to do that, so I stopped. Aunt Helen told my father not to hit me in front of her ever again
and my father said this was his house and he would do what he wanted and my mom was quiet and
so were my brother and sister.
 I don’t remember much more than that because I started crying really hard and after a while my
dad had my mom take me to my room. It wasn’t until much later that my mom had a few glasses
of white wine and told me what happened to her sister. Some people really do have it a lot worse
than I do. They really do.
 I should probably go to sleep now. It’s very late. I don’t know why I wrote a lot of this down
for you to read. The reason I wrote this letter is because I start high school tomorrow and I am really afraid of going.
 Love always,
 Charlie
