I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn’t try to sleep with that
person at that party even though you could have. Please don’t try to figure out who she is because
then you might figure out who I am, and I really don’t want you to do that. I will call people by
different names or generic names because I don’t want you to find me. I didn’t enclose a return address for the same reason. I mean nothing bad by this. Honest.
 I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn’t try to sleep with
people even if they could have. I need to know that these people exist.
 I think you of all people would understand that because I think you of all people are alive and
appreciate what that means. At least I hope you do because other people look to you for strength
and friendship and it’s that simple. At least that’s what I’ve heard.
 So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I’m still trying to
figure out how that could be.
