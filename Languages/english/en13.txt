“specialist” and he knew my name even though I wasn’t wearing a name tag like they do in open
house.
 “Well, I think that Michael was a nice guy and I don’t understand why he did it. As much as I
feel sad, I think that not knowing is what really bothers me.”
 I just reread that and it doesn’t sound like how I talk. Especially in that office because I was crying still. I never did stop crying.
 The counselor said that he suspected that Michael had “problems at home” and didn’t feel like
he had anyone to talk to. That’s maybe why he felt all alone and killed himself.
 Then, I started screaming at the guidance counselor that Michael could have talked to me. And
I started crying even harder. He tried to calm me down by saying that he meant an adult like a
teacher or a guidance counselor. But it didn’t work and eventually my brother came by the middle
school in his Camaro to pick me up.
 For the rest of the school year, the teachers treated me different and gave me better grades even
though I didn’t get any smarter. To tell you the truth, I think I made them all nervous.
 Michael’s funeral was strange because his father didn’t cry. And three months later he left Michael’s mom. At least according to Dave at lunchtime. I think about it sometimes. I wonder what
went on in Michael’s house around dinner and TV shows. Michael never left a note or at least his
parents didn’t let anyone see it. Maybe it was “problems at home.” I wish I knew. It might make
me miss him more clearly. It might have made sad sense.
 One thing I do know is that it makes me wonder if I have “problems at home” but it seems to
me that a lot of other people have it a lot worse. Like when my sister’s first boyfriend started going
around with another girl and my sister cried for the whole weekend.
