A proclamation is a proclamation, witcher, but law
is law – and I take care of law and order in Wyzim. I will not
allow people to be murdered! Do you understand?’
The Rivian nodded to show he understood. Velerad snorted
with anger.
‘You carry the witcher’s emblem?’ The stranger reached into
his jerkin once more and pulled out a round medallion on a silver
chain. It pictured the head of a wolf, baring its fangs. ‘And do
you have a name? Any name will do, it’s simply to make conversation easier.’
‘My name is Geralt.’
‘Geralt, then. Of Rivia I gather, from your accent?’
‘Of Rivia.’
‘Right. Do you know what, Geralt? This,’ Velerad slapped the
proclamation, ‘let it go. It’s a serious matter. Many have tried and
failed already. This, my friend, is not the same as roughing up a
couple of scoundrels.’
‘I know. This is my job, Velerad. And that proclamation offers
a three thousand oren reward.’
