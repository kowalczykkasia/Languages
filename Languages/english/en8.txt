Velerad, castellan of Wyzim, scratched his chin. He was neither
superstitious nor faint-hearted but he did not relish the thought
of being alone with the white-haired man. At last he made up his
mind.
‘Leave,’ he ordered the guards. ‘And you, sit down. No, not
there. Further away, if you please.’
The stranger sat down. He no longer carried his sword or black
coat.
‘I am Velerad, castellan of Wyzim,’ said Velerad, toying with a
heavy mace lying on the table. ‘And I’m listening. What do you
have to say to me, you brigand, before you are thrown into the
dungeon? Three killed and an attempted spell-casting; not bad,
not bad at all. Men are impaled for such things in Wyzim. But
I’m a just man, so I will listen to you, before you are executed.
Speak.’
