Later, it was said the man came from the north, from Ropers
Gate. He came on foot, leading his laden horse by the bridle. It
was late afternoon and the ropers’, saddlers’ and tanners’ stalls
were already closed, the street empty. It was hot but the man had
a black coat thrown over his shoulders. He drew attention to
himself.
He stopped in front of the Old Narakort Inn, stood there for a
moment, listened to the hubbub of voices. As usual, at this hour,
it was full of people.
The stranger did not enter the Old Narakort. He pulled his
horse further down the street to another tavern, a smaller one,
called The Fox. Not enjoying the best of reputations, it was almost
empty.
