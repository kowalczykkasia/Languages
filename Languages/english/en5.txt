The stranger did not sit at the table with the few other guests.
He remained standing at the counter, piercing the innkeeper with
his gaze. He drew from the tankard.
‘I’m looking for a room for the night.’
‘There’s none,’ grunted the innkeeper, looking at the guest’s
boots, dusty and dirty. ‘Ask at the Old Narakort.’
‘I would rather stay here.’
‘There is none.’ The innkeeper finally recognised the stranger’s
accent. He was Rivian.
‘I’ll pay.’ The outsider spoke quietly, as if unsure, and the
whole nasty affair began. A pockmarked beanpole of a man who,
from the moment the outsider had entered had not taken his
gloomy eyes from him, got up and approached the counter. Two
of his companions rose behind him, no more than two paces away.
