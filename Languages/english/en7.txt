‘I’ll come by myself,’ repeated the stranger in his resounding,
metallic voice. ‘And the three of you will go in front of me. Take
me to the castellan. I don’t know the way.’
‘Yes, sir,’ mumbled the guard, dropping his head. He made
towards the exit, looking around tentatively. The other two guards
followed him out backwards, hastily. The stranger followed in
their tracks, sheathing his sword and dagger. As they passed the
tables the remaining customers hid their faces from the dangerous
stranger.
