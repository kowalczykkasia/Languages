 My dad said, “There are other people who have it a lot worse.”
 And my mom was quiet. And that was that. A month later, my sister met another boy and
started playing happy records again. And my dad kept working. And my mom kept sweeping.
And my brother kept fixing his Camaro. That is, until he left for college at the beginning of the
summer. He’s playing football for Penn State but he needed the summer to get his grades right to
play football.
 I don’t think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very
pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle. I get straight A’s now like my sister and that is
why they leave me alone.
 My mom cries a lot during TV programs. My dad works a lot and is an honest man. My Aunt
Helen used to say that my dad was going to be too proud to have a midlife crisis. It took me until
around now to understand what she meant by that because he just turned forty and nothing has
changed.
 My Aunt Helen was my favorite person in the whole world. She was my mom’s sister. She got
straight A’s when she was a teenager and she used to give me books to read. My father said that the
books were a little too old for me, but I liked them so he just shrugged and let me read.
